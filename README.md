# HOSTS

HOSTS files can help protect educational environments from inappropriate
materials online, unproductivity, and malware.

This project started out in a production environment within a technology
classroom in an after school center in Boston, MA that saw 100+ children each
day between the ages of 8 through 18.

The goal of these lists was to only allow games on Fridays while keeping a
generally safe environment for children.  Creative projects would be made
Monday-Thursday.

WARNING: An unmanaged proprietary content filter was used in addition to these
HOSTS files.  These lists are not complete and does not claim or attempt to be
complete.

If you have network access, I would recommend using the individual
[filters](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/HOSTS/blob/master/filters/)
with a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).

Manually updating and copying these files can be cumbersome so the process
should be automated such as
[this example for Windows](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/BAT/blob/master/dles.bat)
or
[this example for Mac](https://github.com/BlueHillBGCB/bash/blob/master/updatehosts.sh).

## Categories

There are six main types of files here.

- [Filters](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/HOSTS/blob/master/filters/)
  that make up the rest of the lists.
- F files allow games.
- MTWR files block games.
- win files use the End of Line formatting for Windows systems.
- unix files use the End of Line formatting for Linux, Mac, routers, and Unix
  systems.
- LS files redirect to a local web server instead of giving an error.

## Contributions

I am looking for help with the following:

- Adding domains to the filtered lists found in the `filters/` directory.
- Correcting improper categorazation.

## More information

- localhost is used to configure the loopback interface.
- Loopbacks can redirect the domain to the IP address of your choosing.
- 127.0.0.1 goes nowhere.
- LS files can redirect inappropriate websites to a local web server full of
  constructive opportunities.  This is much better than the alternative of
  hitting a content filter dead end.
- [This script](https://github.com/BlueHillBGCB/bash/blob/master/updateallhosts.sh)
  builds each variation of these files automatically.
