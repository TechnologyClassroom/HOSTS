The goal is to only allow games on Fridays while keeping a generally safe
environment for children.  Creative projects should be made Monday-Thursday.

Manually updating and copying these files can be cumbersome so the process
should be automated such as
[this example for Windows](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/BAT/blob/master/dles.bat)
or
[this example for Mac](https://github.com/BlueHillBGCB/bash/blob/master/updatehosts.sh).

WARNING: I use this in addition to a content filter.  This is not complete and
does not claim to be.

There are five main types of files here.

- F files allow games.
- MTWR files block games.
- win files use the End of Line formatting for Windows systems.
- unix files use the End of Line formatting for Linux, Mac, routers, and Unix
  systems.
- LS files redirect to a local web server instead of giving an error.

I am looking for help with the following:

- Adding domains to HOSTSMTWRwin.txt or HOSTSFwin.txt
- Correcting improper categorazation

More information:

- localhost is used to configure the loopback interface.
- Loopbacks can redirect the domain to the IP address of your choosing.
- 127.0.0.1 goes nowhere.
- LS files can redirect inappropriate websites to a local web server full of
  constructive opportunities.  This is much better than the alternative of
  hitting a content filter dead end.
- [This script](https://github.com/BlueHillBGCB/bash/blob/master/updateallhosts.sh)
  builds each variation of these files automatically.
